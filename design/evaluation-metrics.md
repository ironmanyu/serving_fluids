# Project Evaluation Metrics
This document contains some metrics that we could use the evaluate the performance of the robot.
## Technical Metrics
We can actually test some of the technical metrics on our project.
### Navigation Metrics
- Accuracy and Precision:
    - How close did the robot get to the specified waypoint?
- Success Rate:
    - How many times was the robot able to get to the specified waypoint?
    - How many times was the robot able to make it through a doorway?
- Time:
    - How long did it take the robot to get to the specified waypoint?
### Pick and Place Metrics
- Accuracy and Precision:
    - How close did the robot place the can to the target position?
- Success Rate:
    - How many times was the robot able to identify the can?
    - How many times was the robot able to pick up the can?
    - How many times was the robot able to tuck the can?
    - How many times was the robot able to place the can?
- Time:
    - How long did it take the robot to pick up the can?
    - How long did it take the robot to tuck the can?
    - How long did it take the robot to place the can?
## Human-Centered Metrics
Because our project is not at a high enough level of completeness and
because we do not have access to a real nursing home with residents and caregivers,
we cannot test our project against these human-centered metrics.
Instead, we are creating these metrics for the exercise of determining useful metrics.
- Residents:
    - How much more hydrated are the residents with the robot than without it?
        - Could be measured via liquid intake, or some other method
    - How often do residents voluntarily use the robot?
        - Do they summon the robot over (or use whatever other interfaces we make available)?
        - Do they prefer a human to bring them their drinks?
- Caregivers:
    - How much less time did they spend on hydration?
        - Could be time spent handing out water, time spent checking for dehydration
    - Do caregivers feel like the robot makes their jobs easier?
